# chess-js
This is an Object-oriented JavaScript chess-game engine.

It has a simple interface which allows you to make moves in a chess game.
The engine will check whether your move is legal, and will allow the move if it is.

No plans currently to implement an AI opponent - to use it, you will need to play against yourself or a friend :)
